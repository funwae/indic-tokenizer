# Notes & Open Questions

We keep track of unresolved design decisions here.

- How aggressive should morphology-aware segmentation be for Hindi?

- For Sanskrit, do we expose multi-hypothesis sandhi segmentations by default?

- How do we best handle Romanized Hindi (in Latin script) mixed with Devanagari?

- What is the right tradeoff between:

  - Lowest fertility

  - Highest human-perceived "naturalness"

  - Best downstream performance

We'll update this as we run experiments and gather community feedback.
